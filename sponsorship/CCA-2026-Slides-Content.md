### Content:
```
CRYPTO COMMONS GATHERING 2026

Sponsorship & Partnership Opportunities

Building the Future of Digital Commons Together
```

**Footer:** cryptocommonsgather.ing | contact@crypto-commons.org

**Speaker Notes:**
Welcome. Today I'm presenting sponsorship opportunities for the Crypto Commons Gathering 2026 — the flagship event of the Crypto Commons Association. This isn't another crypto conference. This is where regenerative blockchain infrastructure is being designed.

## SLIDE 2: What is Crypto Commons?
**Layout:** Title + body text

### Content:
```
WHAT IS CRYPTO COMMONS?

A paradigm shift in economic system design

• Distributed Ledger Technology — Trustless, transparent infrastructure

• Commons Governance — Collective stewardship of shared resources

• Tokenomics — Incentive alignment for public goods

• Regenerative Economics — Systems that restore rather than deplete
```

**Visual suggestion:** Abstract network/mycelium graphic

**Speaker Notes:**
Crypto commons represent a fundamental shift. Unlike traditional crypto focused on extraction, crypto commons use market mechanisms to reward contributions to the common good. We're building systems that regenerate rather than deplete.

## SLIDE 3: Why Now?

WHY NOW?

organizations are seeking sustainable models
that create #RealValue"

The CCA has been building the intellectual and practical
foundation since 2021:

✓ Peer-reviewed research
✓ Working implementations
✓ Global practitioner community
```

**Speaker Notes:**
The timing is critical. The industry is ready for models that work. We've been building this foundation for years, and 2026 is a pivotal moment to shape the direction of regenerative blockchain.
