I'm reaching out from the Crypto Commons Association regarding partnership opportunities for our flagship event, the **Crypto Commons Gathering 2026**.

[Organization] stood out to us because of your work on [specific project/initiative]. Your commitment to [relevant value — e.g., "regenerative economics" / "decentralized governance" / "public goods funding"] aligns closely with the crypto commons mission.

**What is the Crypto Commons Gathering?**

This is the annual convening of researchers, developers, and practitioners building blockchain infrastructure for the common good — where academic rigor meets practical implementation, and where regenerative economics is being designed in real-time.

**Why partner with us?**

- Position [Organization] at the forefront of regenerative crypto
- Connect with 200+ values-aligned builders and decision-makers
- Support peer-reviewed research advancing the field
- Gain speaking opportunities and brand visibility

**Our community includes:**

Regen Network, Holochain, Tezos, Namada, Bread Cooperative, Grassroots Economics, and other leading regenerative projects.

I'd love to schedule a brief call to discuss how [Organization] could engage — whether as a sponsor, speaker, or collaborator.

Are you available for a 20-minute conversation next week?

Best,
