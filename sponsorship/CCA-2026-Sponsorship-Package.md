## Executive Summary

The **Crypto Commons Gathering 2026** is the flagship annual event of the Crypto Commons Association (CCA), bringing together leading researchers, developers, practitioners, and visionaries at the forefront of blockchain-based commons governance.

This is not another crypto conference. This is where the future of regenerative digital infrastructure is being designed—where market mechanisms meet the common good, and where distributed ledger technology becomes a tool for planetary stewardship.

**Your sponsorship directly supports:**
- Groundbreaking research in crypto commons
- Open-source tools for regenerative economies
- A global community building digital public goods
- Academic publications advancing the field

## Why Crypto Commons?

### The Opportunity

Crypto commons represent a paradigm shift in how we design economic systems. Unlike traditional crypto projects focused on extraction, crypto commons actively use market mechanisms and economic incentives to **reward contributions to the common good**.

This emerging interdisciplinary field combines:
- **Distributed Ledger Technology** — Trustless, transparent infrastructure
- **Commons Governance** — Collective stewardship of shared resources
- **Tokenomics** — Incentive alignment for public goods
- **Regenerative Economics** — Systems that restore rather than deplete

### Why Now?

As the crypto industry matures beyond speculation, organizations and communities are seeking sustainable models that create **#RealValue**. The CCA has been building the intellectual and practical foundation for this transition since 2021, publishing peer-reviewed research, developing frameworks, and convening practitioners.

The 2026 Gathering represents a pivotal moment to shape the direction of regenerative blockchain infrastructure.
