              Crypto commons are a subset of digital commons emerging in the context of Distributed Ledger Technology.
              They comprise base layer protocols, applications built on top of them as well as tools and mechanisms used
              in their design and calibration.

                In contrast to pre-DLT commons, they usually make active use of market mechanisms and economic
                incentives in order to reward contributions to the common good.

              Their solid grounding in market mechanism design as well as their distributed and permissionless operation
              by loose networks of incentivized supporters opens up the possibility of scaling Commons frameworks beyond
              the local and immediate.

              As a computational and organizational substrate for decentralized economies, they reinvigorate
